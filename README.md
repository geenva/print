# Print

> ðŸ”§ | Small utility to implement the print() function in Python in TypeScript.

This is a lightweight utility which includes a class and a function. The function `print()` just `console.log`s the argument provided. The class includes 6 functions, which are `print()`, `noWarnErr()`, `noWarnError()`, `warn()`, `err()` anad `error()`. An instance of the class is then exported, which you can use.

Examples are provided in [this directory](examples/).
