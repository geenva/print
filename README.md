# Print

> ðŸ”§ | Small utility to implement the print() function in Python in TypeScript.

This is a lightweight utility which includes a class and a function. The function `print()` just `console.log()`s the argument provided. The class includes 6 functions, which are `print(args)`, `noWarnErr(args)`, `noWarnError(args)`, `warn(args)`, `err(args)` anad `error(args)`. An instance of the class is then exported, which you can use.

Examples are provided in [this directory](examples/).
